Merfolk mod is a mod which changes the way you play terraria completely (for most of the game)
This mod puts a curse on you which turns you into a merman.
Being dry/not wet for 600 ticks/around 10 secs (depends on FPS)
Once you play the game the dragable interface will pop up counting down form 10 secs but will first apper 11 seconds so you see all 10 seconds
You'll spawn with 2 scrolls that are gills potions with information on them.
